<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Mobile marketing has come a long way, but it’s still heavily reliant on retention. While customer acquisition is important, constant retention strategies trump repeat advances through downloadable apps, social media access and web page access.</p>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">There’s a reason <a href="http://www.inboundo.co/business/cold-hard-marketing-stats-drive-next-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">over 6.8 billion people use smartphones</a>, and there’s a reason mobile traffic constitutes 30 percent of the Internet world’s data. Consumers stick to their needs. This year, their needs are focused on repeat usage. Check out the following reasons for retention-centric strategies below.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2759" src="https://ttbagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/personalized-data.jpg" alt="personalized-data" width="800" height="600" />
<h2>Reason One: Personalized Data Favors Repeat Customers</h2>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">The smartphone is a customer extension. It’s an immersive, personal platform capable of surpassing other media channels. For this reason, mobile marketers need to be constantly aware of the dynamic digital channel’s targeting potential. Customers want deep, intimate connections, and they’re being dished out data-driven deals every year.</p>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Because much of the mobile world is data-centric, mobile marketers have reworked entire strategies to create powerful solutions based upon the customer’s wants and needs. They needn’t focus on power-packing audiences up front.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2761" src="https://ttbagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mobile-apps-are-in-priority.jpg" alt="Mobile-apps-are-in-priority" width="800" height="600" />
<h2>Reason Two: Mobile Apps are Being Prioritized</h2>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">While millions of apps are downloaded annually, customers adhere to only a few. That’s right: Buyers are relying on a maximum of four apps to go about day-to-day activities.</p>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Additionally, 79 percent of smartphone users report using apps on a daily basis. If you want to boost ROI, you should focus on retention through mobile apps.</p>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Mobile apps experience a high volume of repeat visits, and they’re even becoming prioritized by consumers seeking social media access.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2>Reason Three: Automated SMS is a Superior Outreach Channel</h2>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">While SMS can be used to garner initial followers, <a href="http://textpedite.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">providers like Textpedia</a> are using it to bolster existing audiences. Businesses are creating keyword-triggered campaigns, and they’re sending out automatic updates to subscribers. By targeting buyers with promotional messages, digital offers and highly informational texts, your business can boost retention and promote further outreach.</p>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Automated SMS providers remove the legwork of slam-firing texts. In doing so, they give businesses the freedom they need to craft powerful CTAs and send out meaningful content.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2757" src="https://ttbagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/location-based-serives.jpg" alt="location-based-serives" width="800" height="600" />
<h2>Reason Four: Location-Based Services Prioritize Repeat Customers</h2>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">In 2015, Google reported that <a href="http://www.nextechage.com/seven-ways-enhance-mobile-marketing-strategy-2016/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">85 percent of the world’s top 100 retailers</a> will likely adopt location-based technology before 2016 ends. Why? Because mobile deals have gone local. Mobile beacons, in 2016, are a big deal.</p>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Consumers are turning to location-based marketing to utilize one-time-only deals, location-specific amenities and in-store offers. Because mobile technology will only get sharper, businesses will rely on micro-targeted services to promote products, determine value and create ongoing value through continuous services.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2766" src="https://ttbagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mobile-video-is-the-future.jpg" alt="mobile-video-is-the-future" width="800" height="600" />
<h2>Reason Five: Mobile Video is the Future</h2>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">If you’ve ever seen a viral YouTube video, you know how potent Internet media can be. In 2015, mobile took the reins, and it’s continuing to be a primary platform for consumed digital media. 60 percent of web traffic is expected to be mobile by the year’s end, and <a href="http://trumpia.com/blog/power-video-mobile-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">50 percent of all traffic</a> is expected to be video.</p>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">When paired with the fact that 80 percent of a business’s future revenue is derived from <a href="http://trumpia.com/blog/power-video-mobile-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">20 percent of its repeat customers</a>, retention-based marketing appears to be a winning strategy. A lot of app developers have poured time, money and innovation into consumer-targeted ad campaigns. They’ve also focused on word-of-mouth tactics to take advantage of social media.</p>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">If you want to boost your revenue, you’ll need to step up your retention game. Mobile users can be fickle, and they’ll drop a brand not offering ongoing value.</p>
<p class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">It’s 2016, and it’s time to settle the score. Create a strategy conducive to retention, woo your buyers and secure an audience capable of lasting a lifetime.</p>
