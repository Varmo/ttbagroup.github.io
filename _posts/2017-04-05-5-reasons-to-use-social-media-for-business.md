<span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Before going into the reasons why you should use <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-guide-small-businesses/" target="_blank">social media for business</a>, let's face it: nearly everyone uses social media today. It's being integrated more and more into our lifes. People use it on a daily basis and in many cases they are likely to spend more time checking their Facebook or Twitter news feeds than watching TV or reading newspapers. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">In this article we share 5 reasons you should use social media for business and how your company can benefit from it.</span>
<h3><strong>1. Be visible at the right time</strong></h3>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">You may be an expert in your industry, but if you don't build your company's social media presence, positioning your business in front of <a href="/?p=1564" target="_blank">new customers</a> is very challenging. Of course, you can just go with the traditional advertising tools: newspapers, magazines, radio. If you have enough budget you can even advertise your product or service on TV. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">But all these advertising mediums cannot provide you with accurate analytics. How many people were exposed to your message, viewed it and what type of engagement, if any, followed afterwards. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Instead of investing a lot of money in direct advertising, <span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">give your customers a chance to find you when they need you.</span> Secure a place online for your business.</span>
<h3><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1502 size-column1-1/2" src="https://ttbagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tablet_man_hires-1140x570.jpg" alt="TTBA-Be-Visible-Online" width="1140" height="570" /></h3>
<h3><strong>2. Interact with your audience</strong></h3>
<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">You can't pitch your business face-to-face to everyone in your target market. Actually you can, but it will take countless hours and it won't be very productive. There is no guarantee that any one person that you speak with really needs to buy your product or service. </span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Instead of wasting time and energy on those who are not interested, you can chose to communicate with the people that are most likely to buy from you. </span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">For example, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/business/help/200000840044554" target="_blank">Facebook Ads manager</a> lets you target your audience base on age, interests, hobbies, professional field and other characteristics. You expose your brand to a target audience that you know is interested in your products or an audience that you would like to test.</span>
<h3><strong>3. Share content related to your industry</strong></h3>
<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Give the people what they are looking for - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_marketing" target="_blank">Valuable Content</a>. Figure out the topics that interest your customers and share with them interesting news, photos, videos, articles and blog-posts that reflect your business ideas. If done right, you will get people thinking about buying the services that you offer. </span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">It's also a great way to engage more people. As soon as your posts get likes and shares on the social media channels, there's a chance of that post snowballing into a very large reach.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1738" src="https://ttbagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/smm_graphics.png" alt="Promote-On-Social-Media" width="737" height="422" /></span>
<h3><strong>4. Promote your website and blog</strong></h3>
<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Writing a blog about something that has a value for your target customers is a great idea. It proves that you love what you do, that you have knowledge and experience in what your domain. In order to get more people to read your articles and to drive more visitors to your website, share the links on your company's social media platforms.</span>

<h3><strong>5. Convert your followers into customers</strong></h3>
<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Finally, add <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-call-to-action-faqs-ht" target="_blank">calls-to-action</a> to your company's social media pages so that it leads directly to your website. Make it easy and intuitive to buy your product or to take advantage of a discount. Make it simple for people to reach you.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">These days it's a must for a small and medium businesses to have their page on social media. Why keep your brand disconnected from the social network? It is easy to use, perfect to communicate with your target audience and the best part is that you don't have to pay to get your business page, it is completely free!</span>
